2. Get your Merchant ID and Merchant Key
3. Update the `usePayment.ts` hook to use PayFast API
4. Add environment variables for PayFast credentials

#### Alternative: Stripe
1. Sign up at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
2. Install Stripe SDK: `npm install @stripe/stripe-js`
3. Update payment processing logic

### Test Payment Flow
Currently implemented with:
- 90% success rate simulation
- 2-second processing delay
- Proper database updates on success
- Error handling and rollback on failure

## üîß Environment Variables
