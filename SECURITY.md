# Security Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in IronledgerMedMap and provides guidelines for maintaining security in production.

## Recent Security Improvements

### âœ… Completed Security Fixes

1. **Removed Hardcoded Credentials**
   - Eliminated hardcoded Supabase credentials from source code
   - Removed hardcoded admin password
   - Implemented environment variable configuration

2. **Secure Authentication Flow**
   - Removed hardcoded admin authentication
   - Implemented role-based authentication through database
   - Added proper admin user creation process

3. **Payment Security**
   - Removed default PayFast credentials
   - Required proper environment variable configuration
   - Added validation for payment credentials

4. **Input Validation**
   - Implemented comprehensive form validation using Zod
   - Added email, password, and phone number validation
   - South African specific validations (ID numbers, phone numbers)

## Current Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth**: Email/password authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Doctor, User roles
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling

### Data Protection
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration moved to env vars
- **Database Security**: RLS policies on all tables
- **Input Sanitization**: Zod validation schemas
- **Client-Side Validation**: Form validation before submission

### Payment Security
- **Environment Configuration**: No hardcoded payment credentials
- **Provider Abstraction**: Support for multiple payment providers
- **Sandbox Mode**: Safe testing environment
- **Transaction Logging**: Proper audit trails

## Security Checklist for Production

### Environment Setup
- [ ] All environment variables properly configured
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- [ ] Separate dev/staging/production configurations
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS enabled for all environments

### Database Security
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- [ ] Service role keys secured server-side only
- [ ] Database backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Authentication
- [ ] Strong password policies enforced
- [ ] Email verification implemented
- [ ] Session timeout configured
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication considered

### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] API versioning strategy

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry integration available)
- [ ] Access logging
- [ ] Security event alerting
- [ ] Regular security scanning

## Environment Variables Reference

### Required Variables
```env
# Supabase (Required)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# PayFast (Required for South African payments)
VITE_PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID=your_payfast_merchant_id
VITE_PAYFAST_MERCHANT_KEY=your_payfast_merchant_key
VITE_PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE=your_payfast_passphrase
VITE_PAYFAST_SANDBOX=true

# Application
VITE_APP_URL=your_app_url
```

### Security Best Practices for Environment Variables
1. Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. Use different keys for dev/staging/production
3. Rotate keys regularly
4. Use minimal permissions for each service
5. Monitor key usage and access

## Incident Response

### If Security Breach Suspected
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Change all API keys and passwords
   - Review access logs
   - Notify affected users if necessary
   - Document the incident

2. **Investigation**:
   - Identify scope of breach
   - Determine root cause
   - Assess data impact
   - Review security measures

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement fixes
   - Restore services securely
   - Update security procedures
   - Conduct post-incident review

## Compliance Considerations

### South African POPIA Compliance
- User consent for data processing
- Data minimization principles
- Right to data portability
- Data retention policies
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions

### Medical Data Security
- Patient confidentiality
- Access logging for medical records
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure backup procedures
- Staff access controls

## Regular Security Tasks

### Monthly
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Rotate non-critical API keys
- [ ] Security awareness training

### Quarterly
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security policy review
- [ ] Incident response drill
- [ ] Third-party security assessments

### Annually
- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Compliance assessment
- [ ] Business continuity testing
- [ ] Security architecture review
